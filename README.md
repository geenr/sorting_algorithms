this is all about sorting algorithmns
we will majorly focus on the following sorting methods
insertion sort
bubble sort
selection sort
quick sort
we are also going to look at Big O notation which helps check for the efficiency of an algorithmn in terms of time and space hence we are going to look at the best case, average case and worst case scenario for all methods to determine the best sorting method to use
although all sorting methods are good and non is specifically best, it is all depent on the machine being used and the users requirement
bubble sort
	best case time complexity O(n)
	average case O(n ^ 2)
	worst case O(n ^ 2)
	space O(1)
insertion sort
	best case time complaxity O(n)
	average case O(n ^ 2)
	worst case O(n ^2)
	space O(1)
selection sort
	best case time complexity O(n ^ 2)
	average case O(n ^ 2)
	worst case O(n ^ 2)
	space O(1)
quick sort
	best case time complexity O(n log n)
	average case O(n log n)
	worst case O(n ^ 2)
	space O(log n)
